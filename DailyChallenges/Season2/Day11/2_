## Essential Tools for Managing Text File Contents (Table 4-2)
| Command | Explanation                                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `less`  | Opens a file in a pager for easy reading and scrolling                      |
| `cat`   | Displays the entire file contents on the screen                             |
| `head`  | Shows the first few lines of a file (default: 10)                           |
| `tail`  | Shows the last few lines of a file (default: 10)                            |
| `cut`   | Filters specific columns or characters from a file                         |
| `sort`  | Sorts the file contents alphabetically or numerically                      |
| `wc`    | Counts lines, words, and characters in a file                               |

### Versatility with Pipes
These commands shine when paired with pipes:
- `less /etc/passwd`: View the `/etc/passwd` file.
- `ps aux | less`: Pipe process list output to `less` for scrollable reading.

## Mastering `less`
The `less` utility is a go-to tool for reading text files as a Linux admin.

### Usage
- Open a file: `less /etc/passwd`
- Navigate: Use **Page Up**/**Page Down** to scroll, press **`q`** to quit.
- Search:
  - Forward: `/sometext`
  - Backward: `?sometext`
  - Repeat: **`n`**

### Connection to `vim` and `man`
`less` shares navigation and search mechanics with `vim` and `man` due to their common code base.

> **Note:**  
> `less` was created to outdo `more`, a basic pager, inspiring the phrase "do more with less." Today, both tools have similar features, but `more` exits at file end (use `-p` to change this) and is standard everywhere, while `less` may require installation.

## Exercise 1: Applying Basic `less` Skills

### Objective

Practice using the `less` command to view and navigate through text files.

### Steps

1. **Open a File:**
Open the `/etc/passwd` file using `less`:

```bash
less /etc/passwd
```

2. **Search:**
Type `/root` to search for and highlight all occurrences of "root" in the file.
3. **Go to End:**
Press `G` to jump to the last line of the file.
4. **Quit:**
Press `q` to exit the `less` viewer.
5. **Pipe Output:**
Pipe the output of the `ps aux` command to `less` to browse the process list:

```bash
ps aux | less
```

6. **Quit Again:**
Press `q` to exit the `less` viewer.
