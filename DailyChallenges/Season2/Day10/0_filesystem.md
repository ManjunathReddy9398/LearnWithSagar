### Linux Filesystem Overview

The Linux filesystem is a hierarchical structure used to store all information on a computer. It is based on the UNIX system, where nearly everything, including data, commands, symbolic links, devices, and directories, is represented within the filesystem.

### Structure and Navigation

1. **Hierarchy**: The filesystem is organized like an upside-down tree with the root directory (`/`) at the top. Below the root are common directories such as `/bin`, `/dev`, `/home`, `/lib`, and `/tmp`. These directories can contain subdirectories, creating a hierarchical structure.
2. **Paths**:
    * **Full Path**: Specifies the complete route from the root directory to a file or directory (e.g., `/home/joe/Documents/memos/memo1.doc`).
    * **Relative Path**: Specifies the path relative to the current directory (e.g., `memo1.doc` if the current directory is `/home/joe/Documents/memos`).

### Common Linux Directories

#### Key Directories

- **`/bin`**: Contains common Linux user commands like `ls`, `sort`, `date`, and `chmod`.
- **`/boot`**: Contains the bootable Linux kernel and boot loader configuration files (GRUB).
- **`/dev`**: Contains files representing access points to devices (e.g., `tty*`, `fd*`, `hd*`, `sd*`, `ram*`, `cd*`).
- **`/etc`**: Contains administrative configuration files, which are typically plaintext files that can be edited with a text editor.
- **`/home`**: Contains directories for each regular user account (except root, which uses `/root`).
- **`/media`**: Standard location for automatically mounting devices, particularly removable media.
- **`/lib`**: Contains shared libraries required by applications in `/bin` and `/sbin` to boot the system.
- **`/mnt`**: A common mount point for devices, often used for temporarily mounting local or remote filesystems.
- **`/misc`**: Sometimes used to automatically mount filesystems upon request.
- **`/opt`**: Used to store add-on application software.
- **`/proc`**: Contains information about system resources.
- **`/root`**: The home directory for the root user, located outside `/home` for security reasons.
- **`/sbin`**: Contains administrative commands and daemon processes.
- **`/tmp`**: Contains temporary files used by applications.
- **`/usr`**: Contains user documentation, games, graphical files (X11), libraries, and other commands and files not needed during the boot process.
- **`/var`**: Contains directories of data used by various applications, including FTP server files (`/var/ftp`), web server files (`/var/www`), system log files (`/var/log`), and spool files (`/var/spool`).
